- title: AFWERX
  summary: AFWERX helps the Air Force engage with industry, academia and non-traditional contributors to foster an Air Force culture of innovation. The AFWERX team needed a fully compliant, Fedramp approved solution for their website. The internal solution on offer wasn’t as customizable as AFWERX needed it to be (through control of CSS/JavaScript/HTML) and couldn’t use an S3 bucket. The AFWERX team was particularly interested in how Federalist gave them the flexibility to choose their own template designers and ability to track analytics on the backend.
