This is the template used for the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based [18F
Guides](http://18f.github.io/guides), derived from
[CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter). It is structured to act as an
18F Guides Guide. The repository for this template is
[18F/guides-template](https://github.com/18F/guides-template/).

## Creating a guide

To create a brand new guide, first follow the instructions in the
[README.md](https://github.com/18F/guides-template/blob/master/README.md) file
of this guide's GitHub repository to create a local clone of this template.

Once you've created a new clone, click the _Adding a New Page_ entry in the
table of contents.

## Updating an existing guide

Copy the `_includes`, `_layouts`, and `assets` directories from this template
and follow the instructions in _Updating the Config File_ to update your
`_config.yml` accordingly.

You may also need to consult the _GitHub Setup_ and _Post Your Guide_ chapters
to ensure your guide is correctly published to `18f.github.io` and linked from
the main [18F Guides](http://18f.github.io/guides/) site.
