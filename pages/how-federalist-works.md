title: How Federalist Works
---

## Open source

Federalist is a hosted service run by [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) for use by US federal government agencies. The software behind this service is open source and released to the public domain for anyone to use. We also welcome your contributions and ideas.

We use GitHub to manage our work on Federalist. The main code repository for the Federalist is at [https://github.com/18F/federalist](https://github.com/18F/federalist). In addition to hosting code, we use the issue queue on this repository to manage our development tasks and milestones. If you're interested in getting involved with this project, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/18F/federalist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Here is a specific description of each of Federalist's modular repositories:

### Functional Repositories

- **[federalist](https://github.com/18F/federalist)** This is the core application for Federalist and contains the frontend interface as well as the code that interacts with the GitHub API and sets up new Federalist sites, including a Github webhook that triggers messages into the build queue through the app. It has two cloud.gov service instances (redis and rds) for session storage and persistent data storage of users, sites, and logs.
- **[federalist-builder](https://github.com/18F/federalist-builder)** This application launches build tasks for Federalist in a Linux Garden container based on messages from a queue and contains scheduling logic.
- **[federalist-registry](https://github.com/18F/federalist-registry)** This application hosts the federalist-docker-build image for the federalist-builder application to reference. It uses an [AWS storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/registry/storage-drivers/s3/).
- **[federalist-docker-build](https://github.com/18F/federalist-docker-build)** Pulling from docker-ruby-ubuntu, this container image adds the dependencies and scripts for a Garden Linux container to build out a Federalist site. Note that while the repo is named with "Docker," Docker is not actually used by Federalist.
- **[docker-ruby-ubuntu](https://github.com/18F/docker-ruby-ubuntu)** Container image specification to run in a Garden Linux container.

### Templates and Documentation

- **[federalist-docs](https://github.com/18F/federalist-docs)** This documentation website. It also contains content from the depreciated [federalist-content-guide](https://github.com/18F/federalist-content-guide) repo.
- **[federalist-landing-page-template](https://github.com/18F/federalist-landing-page-template)** A single page meant to host information about a new initiative or report.
- **[federalist-modern-team-template](https://github.com/18F/federalist-modern-team-template)** A simple site to showcase the work of an organization with a few different page types.
- **[federalist-uswds-template](https://github.com/18f/federalist-uswds-template/)** A Federalist template that uses the U.S. Web Design Standards Jekyll theme.




## Architecture

Federalist is located on [cloud.gov's GovCloud environment](https://landing.apps.cloud.gov/docs/apps/govcloud/), which has [received FedRAMP certification](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/index.html#/product/18f-cloudgov). [This blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/02/02/cloud-gov-is-now-fedramp-authorized/) explains more about FedRAMP.

### https://federalist.fr.cloud.gov

Main application server providing an API and front-end website load balanced across at least two instances

Build messages generated by the API are sent to the SQS queue

- GH: 18f/federalist
- CF: -o federalist -s prod -n federalist
- Federalist API: /*
- Federalist front-end: /assets/*

###  GitHub

Changes from the editor are committed to repositories

Commits POST webhook PUSH events to the API

### federalist-database

General application database for the API

- rds shared-psql


### federalist-redis

Session store for user sessions

- redis28 standard


### Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Message queue for handling build requests

- federalist-builds


### https://federalist-builder.18f.gov

Processes build requests from a queue and launches build tasks

Polls the queue for build messages

Message is deleted after a task is initiated

- GH: 18f/federalist-builder
- CF: -o federalist -s prod -n federalist-builder


### Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Runs docker container tasks on EC2s specified in the Cloud Formation template

After receiving a build message, initiate an ECS task

Build status sent back to API over HTTP POST

Static assets synced to S3 using the AWS CLI

- GH: 18f/federalist-docker-build
- ECS cluster: default
- ECS task definition: federalist-builder
- Cloud Formation: EC2ContainerService-default
- EC2 instance
  - Docker image


### Simple Storage Service (S3)

Website bucket for hosting generated static website files

- federalist.18f.gov
- main builds: /site/*
- previews: /preview/*

#### Creating new buckets
*The following guide is intended for use with the new [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), hosted on the GovCloud AWS region.*

There are two buckets, one for each of Federalist's environments (**production** and **staging**).
These buckets *should* be active and properly configured, but there may be times when a developer needs to create a new one. To accomplish this, he developer should follow the [documentation on cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/s3/#add-s3-to-an-application).


Buckets intended to serve websites will need to be created using the `basic-public` plan. Once the bucket is created, the developer must enable CORS access, typically only allowing GET requests to come from the Federalist application the bucket serves.
An example configuration can be found in the [here](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/s3/#allowing-access-from-other-applications).

Finally, the developer will need to enable the website hosting using [the AWS CLI's `s3 website` commnad](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/website.html). These commands expects the developer's local directory to contain a generic 404 page named `404.html`:

```shell
aws s3 cp ./404.html s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/404.html
aws s3 website s3://${BUCKET_NAME} --index-document index.html --error-document 404.html
```

At this point, the bucket should be enabled to host websites generated by Federalist. The final step to allow the Federalist web app to access the bucket is to bind the service instance to the app. To bind the bucket to Federalist, add the name of the service to the environment specific `manifest.yml` file in Federalist, under the `services` key.

**NOTE**: Replacing the binding to the bucket service will point all future builds to the new bucket. Federalist will no longer be able to route to the old bucket, although sites built there will be accsible via the bucket url. Federalist currently only supports a **single bucket per environement**.

### Public Internet

Sites are publicly available as part of an S3 website bucket

CloudFront is used for custom domains
