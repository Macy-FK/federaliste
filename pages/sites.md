As of January 19, 2019, this is required to redirect federalist.18f.gov/sites 
to federalistapp.18f.gov/sites

The federalistapp domain was created in 2019, so most bookmarks and links still
link to federalistapp.18f.gov/sites.

We should remove this page in January 2020, just to give people time to update 
their bookmarks. We could remove the _layouts/blank.html template then as well.
