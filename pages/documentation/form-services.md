Below is a list of service providers, identified through research funded by [GSA's 10x program](https://10x.gsa.gov/). This list is continuously updated, please [suggest an addition](https://github.com/18F/federalist.18f.gov/issues) if you know other form services in use on Federalist.

#### [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)
- Use cases: Newsletter sign ups, contact us, feedback, bug reporting, support requests, other custom forms
- Access: Your agency may already use Google services. If not, Federalist staff can assist you in creating a GSA Affiliated Customer Account (GACA). Some agencies are fully blocked from using Google Forms though; your agency may be able to issue you a special waiver for Google GSuite access.
- Quick tips:
  * [Limit submissions to users with a `.gov` or `.mil` email address](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePimoF0RkiCP62BSIL_yj0yMXEUePNJ9AabPJqq1Xzbp_GVg/viewform) or certain agency affiliation, see how in these [text validation instructions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3378864?hl=en).
  * Link one, or [multiple](https://coe.gsa.gov/connect/contact-us.html#joinus), forms on your page.
  * Keep in mind your form users need to have access to Google GSuite too. If you need to include users who are blocked, post an email address to where they can request a PDF form instead.
- To get started: See if you can [create a google account with your government email](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail). If not, try to open this [test form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePimoF0RkiCP62BSIL_yj0yMXEUePNJ9AabPJqq1Xzbp_GVg/viewform). If you can't, your agency likely fully blocks access to Google Forms. Ask your Office of the Chief Information Officer about acquiring a special waiver.
