Do you need to ask questions of the people visiting your Federalist website? Do you need to ask for their contact info or let them give you feedback? You need a form. This page provides an overview of existing digital form tools and requirements so you can determine which best apply to your agency's situation and get started.

This pages covers:
* [Choosing a form service](#choosing-a-form-service)
* [Form requirements](#form-requirements)

## Choosing a form service
Federalist pages are static websites. This means there is no backend for you to log into to get your agency's form data. You'll need to use a separate form service to use a digital form on your agency's site. Choosing a service depends on what the purpose of your agency's form is. Here are some options:

#### [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)
- Use cases: Newsletter sign ups, contact us, feedback, bug reporting, support requests, other custom forms
- Access: Federalist staff can help you determine if you are able to [create a google account with your government email](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail) or create a GSA Affiliated Customer Account (GACA). Some agencies are fully blocked from using Google Forms; check with your agency if a special waiver for Google GSuite access may be issued.
- Quick tips:
  * [Limit submissions to users with a `.gov` or `.mil` email address](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePimoF0RkiCP62BSIL_yj0yMXEUePNJ9AabPJqq1Xzbp_GVg/viewform) or certain agency affiliation, see how in these [text validation instructions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3378864?hl=en).
  * Link one, or [multiple](https://coe.gsa.gov/connect/contact-us.html#joinus), forms on your page.
  * Some agencies block Google forms, so if you need government employees to answer provide and alternative, such as an email address.
- To get started: Talk to Federalist staff to find out if your agency allows access to Google services.

## Form requirements
Here are some requirements that may apply to your agency's digital form. 

#### The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)
* What it is: The Paperwork Reduction Act determines how federal agencies collect information from the public. Adhering to this law doesn't have to be complicated: [a fantastic guide](https://pra.digital.gov/) has been written to help you understand if and how PRA is applicable to your form. 
* When it applies: To [figure out if PRA applies to your form](https://pra.digital.gov/do-i-need-clearance/), first see if an exemption or generic clearance for common forms applies.
* Tips: If you do need to get PRA approval, then start early! In some cases it can take 6 to 9 months to [get a form approved](https://pra.digital.gov/clearance-process/) for your website. To avoid delaying your work, PRA experts recommend you first try to publish a more basic version of your form that falls under a PRA exemption, while you wait for your full version to be reviewed.
* How to get started: Get in touch with your agency's [PRA contact](https://pra.digital.gov/contact/).


#### 508 Accessibility
What it is: [508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) requires that government websites be fully accessible to people with disabilities. The [21st Century IDEA Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) reinforces this accessibility, and requires a modern user experience.
Tips: We recommend using the [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for your form. Our Federalist [templates](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/templates/) are all built using the USWDS.
- [The USWDS form elements](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/)
- A few pre built [form templates](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-templates/).

The USWDS has ben built to include accessibility and modern web design. It is still best practice to [scan for accessibility compliance](https://accessibility.18f.gov/tools/). If you end up creating a form without using the USWDS, you'll need to do the work to make your form accessible. Use [https://accessibility.18f.gov/](https://accessibility.18f.gov/) as a guide.

#### Privacy Act
What it is: https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/privacy-act-1974.html

Any forms collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will have to comply with their agency's Privacy process. Here is GSA's for reference: [https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/privacy/](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/privacy/). The Federal Records Act also requires that federal agencies publish a list of which systems they keep PII on. These are call System of Record Notices. Each agency publishes a list, [here](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/systems-of-records-privacy-act/system-of-records-notices-sorns-privacy-act) is GSA's for reference.
