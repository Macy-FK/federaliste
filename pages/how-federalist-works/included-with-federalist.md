## What you get with Federalist
We've gotten several questions about the value of purchasing Federalist. Here are some of the work efforts that you benefit from:

### Included with Federalist

* A automatic deployment mechanism for [Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) or static web assets.
* Web-based configuration and a limited content editing tool.
* Premade templates for your sites, in addition to the many sites you can copy in creating your site.
* Easy onboarding or offboarding: Federalist can deploy content from existing GitHub repositories used with other tools. Your Federalist site will also be easy to port to another deployment mechanism if that's ever needed.
* GSA's previous work to procure cloud Infrastructure as a Service with extrodinary uptime so your static sites don't go down once deployed.
* GSA's previous work to build a [robust and secure platform as a service](https://cloud.gov) with upcoming FedRAMP approval so that Federalist is secure.
* User research with people across government that helped us plan the archtecture and core features of Federalist.
* A user community across agencies and vendors using Federalist.
* A permanent team to maintain and patch Federalist as needed.

### Not included with Federalist

* A fully featured CMS. Federalist is not Wordpress, Drupal or one of their competitors. This means that we have fewer features but also a smaller security profile.
