# Updating your Federalist site after renaming your repository

Renaming your site repository will interrupt a site's ability to build.  In order to resume site building, it will require you to add a new site to Federalist with the new repository url.  (Note: Please be aware that if your site is already live, your site public site will be frozen until a security scan is performed on your new site.)

## Steps to 

1. Add the newly named site repository as described [here](/pages/using-federalist/).
2. Follow steps 3-6 of the site [launch checklist](/pages/using-federalist/launch-checklist/)
3. Once the the new site is live, you can opt to delete the old site from within the old site's Site Settings.  (Note: The build history for the old site will be lost and is not transferable to the new site.)
