## Working with YAML

YAML is a markup language. Comments are ignored.  Indentation is important to
keep related options together. We recommend using space characters instead of
tabs for nesting configuration options.


## Working with markdown

You can practice with the [Markdown helper](https://markdown-helper.18f.gov/).


## Working with front matter

Front matter contains configuration variables on a per-page basis. Some
variables are important to Jekyll like `layout` or `permalink`. You can also
include your own variables that can be referenced in your page content and
layouts. Learn more about [Jekyll front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
