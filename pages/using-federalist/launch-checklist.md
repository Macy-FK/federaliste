## Launching a site with Federalist

We've worked to make launching a live site on Federalist as simple as possible. You will need to complete these steps:

1. Sign an IAA with 18F to use Federalist.
2. Verify that your agency accepts the risk of using Federalist.
3. Build your site using the Federalist editor and approve your content.
4. Configure your DNS / URL so www.yourwebsite.gov points to the Federalist system. (Unless discussed otherwise during the IAA process, you will be responsible for securing your desired URL and configuring DNS.)
5. Set up your HTTPS certificate so https://www.yourwebsite.gov loads correctly. (Unless discussed otherwise during the IAA process, you will be responsible for providing a certificate for 18F to load into Federalist's backend system.)
