## Launching a site with Federalist

We've worked to make launching a live on Federalist as simple as possible. Here are the steps you will follow as a Federalist partner:

1. Sign an IAA with 18F to use Federalist
2. Verify your agency accepts the risk of using Federalist.
3. Build your site using the Federalist editor and approve your content.
4. Do your DNS / URL config so www.yourwebsite.gov points to the Federalist system (Unless discussed otherwise, you will be responsible for securing your desired URL and configuring DNS.)
5. HTTPS cert set up so https://www.yourwebsite.gov loads correctly (Unless discussed otherwise, you will be responsible for providing a certificate for 18F to load into Federalist's backend system.)
