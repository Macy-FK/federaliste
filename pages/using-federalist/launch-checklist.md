## Launching a site with Federalist

We've worked to make launching a live on Federalist as simple as possible.

1. Signed IAA with 18F
2. ATO compliance needs satisfied 
3. You approve the site content
4. DNS / URL config (Unless discussed otherwise, you will be responsible for securing your desired URL and configuring DNS.)
5. HTTPS cert set up (Unless discussed otherwise, you will be responsible for providing a certificate for 18F to load into Federalist's backend system.)
