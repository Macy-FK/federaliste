Front matter contains configuration variables on a per-page basis. Some
variables are important to Jekyll like `layout` or `permalink`. You can also
include your own variables that can be referenced in your page content and
layouts. Learn more about [Jekyll front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
