## What you get with Federalist

We've gotten several questions about the value of purchasing Federalist. Here are some of the work efforts that you benefit from:

### Included with Federalist

* A automatic deployment mechanism for [Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) (deploying the contents of the `_site` folder), [Hugo sites](http://gohugo.io/), or static web assets.
* Web-based configuration and access to preview builds.
* 18F's work to complete and maintain an agency Authority to Operate (ATO) for Federalist's hosting, leveraging the cloud.gov System Security Plan (SSP), with a short process to add new sites to the ATO documentation.
* Premade templates for your sites, in addition to the many sites you can copy in creating your site.
* Easy on-boarding or off-boarding: Federalist can deploy content from existing GitHub repositories used with other tools. Your Federalist site will also be easy to port to another deployment mechanism if that's ever needed.
* 404 page support via a support ticket to the Federalist team.
* User research with people across government that helped us plan the architecture and core features of Federalist.
* A user community across agencies and vendors using Federalist.
* A permanent team to maintain and patch Federalist as needed.
* GSA's previous work to procure cloud Infrastructure as a Service with extraordinary uptime so your static sites don't go down once deployed.
* GSA's previous work to build a [robust and secure platform as a service](https://cloud.gov), recognized with a FedRAMP Moderate PATO, so that Federalist underlying technology is secure.

### Not included with Federalist

* A fully featured content management system (CMS). Federalist is not Wordpress, Drupal, or one of their competitors (see a list of government-used CMS's [here](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/content-management-systems-used-by-government-agencies/)). This means that we have fewer features but also a smaller security profile.
