If you'd like to add search functionality to your Federalist site,
we recommend using [DigitalGov Search](https://search.digitalgov.gov/),
a free site search and search analytics service for federal web sites.

You will need to [register](https://search.usa.gov/signup) for DigitalGov Search and follow their [instructions](https://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/go-live.html)
to integrate this service with your Federalist site.
