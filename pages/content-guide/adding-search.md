If you'd like to add search functionality to your Federalist site, we recommend using [Search.gov][], a free site search and search analytics service for federal web sites.

You will need to [register](https://search.usa.gov/signup) for Search.gov and follow their [instructions](https://search.gov/blog/go-live.html) to integrate this service with your Federalist site.

For full details, visit [Search.gov][]. If you need another solution, you can configure a tool like [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com/) that creates a search function run using the client browser.
