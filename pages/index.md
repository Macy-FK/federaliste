title: About Federalist
---

Federalist is a compliant web publishing service for [open source](https://github.com/18F/federalist) [static sites](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/07/11/conversation-about-static-dynamic-websites/) created by the United States federal government. It provides templates for websites and access to cloud-based infrastructure for high-scale hosting along with [several other unique features]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/using-federalist/included-with-federalist/) that offer great value to our agency partners.

The team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) builds and maintains Federalist as a service available to federal government agencies. We also use Federalist to host many of our own websites.

## What can I build with Federalist?

Federalist provides [ready-to-use templates]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/using-federalist/#federalist-templates) for several common website types. You can also use custom website templates based on Jekyll. 18F maintains many Jekyll-based websites that you can fork and adopt.

Possible sites include:

- A simple homepage for your government organization with information about personnel and contact information.

- Data visualization sites that pull data from a separate API server (Federalist does not provide API servers).

- A single page with information about a recently released report that may receive a lot of traffic.

For real world examples, see these [ten existing sites]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/about-federalist/example-sites/) out of the 79 sites currently live on Federalist.
