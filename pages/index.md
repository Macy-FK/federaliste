# About Federalist

Federalist is a compliant web publishing service for [open source](https://github.com/18F/federalist) [static sites](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/07/11/conversation-about-static-dynamic-websites/) created by the United States federal government. It provides templates for websites and access to cloud-based infrastructure for high-scale hosting along with [several other unique features]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/using-federalist/included-with-federalist/) that offer great value to our agency partners.

The team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) builds and maintains Federalist as a service available to federal government agencies. We also use Federalist to host many of our own websites.
