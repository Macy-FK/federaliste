title: About Federalist
---

Federalist is a compliant [open source](https://github.com/18F/federalist) web publishing platform for the United States federal government. It provides templates for websites, an online editor for maintaining content, and cloud-based infrastructure for high-scale, low-cost website hosting.

The team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) builds and maintains it as a hosted service available to federal government agencies.

Federalist is currently under active development. We are working with a select list of partners to test the platform and launch new websites.

## Why static websites?

Federalist generates static websites instead of using a more complex content management system (CMS) like Drupal or Wordpress. There are several advantages to static websites:

- **Less complexity and vulnerability** Avoiding CMSs means avoiding problems like maintaining dynamic server applications (no PHP or Apache / IIS) and database scaling and redundancy. Production-level static sites generally require one simple static file server or service as opposed to dozens. This means that the whole website is easier to maintain and has fewer vulnerabilities.

- **Update content without writing code** Static websites store content in simple text files that anyone on the team can edit. The Federalist editor provides a way for editing these files without needing to write code.

- **Easy to host and maintain** Itâ€™s very easy to host static website files. You can easily take advantage of scaling services like Amazon S3 where you pay only for what you use.

- **Fully customizable** Designers and developers can customize static websites into whatever form they want without having to strip away CMS-provided features and defaults. Static sites can be used to build many different things, from organization homepages or intranets to pre-generated web application program interfaces (API).

## What can I build with Federalist?
